In our study, we mainly aim to compare and explore two architectures, namely, CNN and LSTM, and they both incorporate the same word vector compressing for the inputs in their networks. The data set we mainly test on is the movie review data that is for sentiment analysis (MR), and it is formed by collections of movie-review documents labeled with respect to their overall sentiment polarity (positive or negative).
